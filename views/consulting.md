### Consulting

I am a freelance full-stack web developer consultant.

I build web applications, both front-end and back-end. I either handle all of the web development myself (or use my own team), or I can work with your team. 

I am an expert at JavaScript and Ruby.

I am relatively expensive for a single individual, and this is because:

* I am really smart.
* I work really fast.
* I am very experienced in this field. 
* If desired, I do the entire full-stack development myself (I take care of everything personally).

You can read more [about me](/about) or just [contact](/contact) me with any question or to ask for referrals. 

Happy hacking! :)
