I graduated with a BSc in Psychology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2012 (Dean's List). My initial interest was **social psychology** and the study of interaction between individuals in a social settings. To this day I think social psychology is a topic of interest to basically everyone. During my studies, I was exposed to other academic branches of psychology and primarily found myself interested in neuropsychology (the underpinnings of the brain) and psychobiology (the same, and extensions of that to non-neural systems such as hormones and pheromones). Truly the human mind is fascinating, and despite psychology often receving a bad rap for being 'non-scientific', the pace and scope of modern-day psychological research is, quite literally, mind-boggling. 

Anyone interested in understanding their own mind should spend some time and learn at least the basics of what modern psychology already knows about us. It is quite illuminating.
