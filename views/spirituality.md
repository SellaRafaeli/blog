So, some things I believe in, which all kind of tie together.

1. **There is no God.** I am an atheist. 

2. **Spirituality is still important.** There is much to be understood and appreciated about our own reality: our brain and our subjective conscious experience. Our brain is pretty amazing; the very existence of subjective experience is quite profound. Appreciating it is not easy, but it is both enlightening and pleasant - this is something we all should be pursuing, both for academic interest and personal gain. 

3. **Free will does not exist.** This is as clear a scientific fact as evolution. We are not in control of our thoughts (this can be attested first-hand by anyone) any more than we are in control of our heartbeat or our digestive systems. The experiencer is not the driver. 

4. **Happiness is important.** Everything else can and should be derived by how much happiness it creates for how many people. 

My favorite contemporary philosopher, whose talks and books I recommend in their entirety, is Sam Harris.
